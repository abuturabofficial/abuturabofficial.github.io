# **Security Concerns and Safe Browsing**

## **Application Ecosystem Security**

### Mobile applications

- Weak passwords
- Malware
- Poorly designed apps

### Rooting and Jail breaking

- Add functionality but also adds vulnerability

### Desktop Software

- Weak passwords
- Not physically secure
- Non-HTTPS browsing

### Business software
  
  Business software automates transactions, mines sales data, manages information, and more.

### Cookies
  
  Cookies are text files with small pieces of data.
  
  ![Safe Browsing Practices](Safe%20Browsing%20Practices-9.png){: w="650" h="350"}
  
  Cookie types:
- Session cookies
- Persistent cookies
- Authentication cookies
- First-party cookies
- Third-party cookies
- Zombie cookies

### Security certificates
  
  Secure sockets layer (SSL) certificates authenticate a website’s identity and enable an encrypted connection between a web server and a browser.

### Browser updates
  
  Because browsers are a favorite target for hackers, keeping them updated is very important.

## **Safe Browsing Techniques**

### Autofill management

### Browser cache and history
  
  A browser cache is a storage data that holds downloads of web pages you’ve visited.

### Private browsing

- You appear as a new or unknown user on the sites you visit.
- Other people who use the device won’t see your history.
- Cookies and site data are deleted when you exit the browser.
- But private browsing activity isn’t hidden from your employer, school, or ISP.
- Bookmarks you create will be kept.
- Downloaded files are saved and may be visible to other users.

### Malicious websites

### Safe websites
  
  Identifying safe websites is more significant than ever.
  
  Safety tips include:
- Use the Whois Lookup tool
- Look for reviews
- Only visit HTTPS sites
- Check the trust seal
- Inspect URLs

### Adware and popups
  
  ![Safe Browsing Practices](Safe%20Browsing%20Practices-15.png){: w="650" h="350"}

### Redirection
  
  The aim of redirection is to point you towards certain types of advertising or dangerous code.
  
  Redirection is caused by:
- Unwanted toolbars or browser extensions
- Malware that alerts searches and URLs
- Hacked websites servers that redirect visitors
  
  To avoid hijacking and redirection:
- Set automatic updates for your browser, OS, and security tools.
- Run regular system scans.

### Warning signs
  
  Search engines use algorithms to detect harmful sites. Browsers use those results to warn users.

## **Security Threats: Virtual Private Networks**
  
  ![Safe Browsing Practices](Safe%20Browsing%20Practices-17.png){: w="650" h="350"}
  
  VPN types:
- Site-to-site VPN
- Host-to-site VPN
- Host-to-host VPN

### VPN hardware
  
  VPN hardware devices are:
- Devices specifically designed to create VPNs
- Network devices with added VPN functionality

### Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
  
  IPsec is a suite of network standards and protocols that use cryptography to protect data traveling over the Internet.
  
  IPsec suite core protocols:
  1. **IPsec Authentication Header (AH) protocol:**
    - Authenticates senders and IP addresses

  2. **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol:**
    - Encrypts data
    - Authenticates data and senders

The IPsec suite has two modes:
