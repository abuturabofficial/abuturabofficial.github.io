# **Virtualization Basics and Cloud Computing**

## **An Overview of Virtualization**

- Allows you to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from a single, physical hardware system.
- Hypervisor/Host
- Virtual Machine/Guest

### Hypervisor

- Separate the physical resources from the virtual environments
- Hypervisors can sit on top of an OS (end user) or be installed directly onto hardware (enterprise).

### Virtual Machine

- The virtual machine functions as a single data file.
- The hypervisor relays requests from the VM to the actual hardware, is necessary.
- VMs doesnâ€™t interact directly with the host machine.
- Physical hardware is assigned to VMs.
