The famous phrase:
> “If you're not paying for it, you become the product.[^1]”

It signifies the long-lost battle of digital privacy[^5]. We gave up our privacy when we signed up for these free-to-use services, thinking that they won't betray us. But they did, and did so bad that there is no way to escape from them, unless we altogether left the online world and start relying on the caveman's method of communication and access to the information.

Is privacy totally lost, or is this blog title merely clickbait? I won't claim it's a complete clickbait, but rather a wake-up call for those who perceive their governments, internet providers, and other e-service providers as entities that won't harm them at all. We can't revert to the pre-internet era, given our extensive involvement and reliance on online connectivity, encompassing banking, schooling, shopping, and social interactions. However, we can make a conscious effort to minimize our online footprint and, whenever possible, refrain from contributing to the colossal data-collection machinery.

The advent of Web 2.0 was based on the generous free tiers offered to the consumers. But that freebie came at the cost of our digital life being exposed to those service providers. What we search on Google, what we watch on YouTube and TikTok, and how we interact with our social circle over on Facebook and Instagram, every step of ours is recorded. Then, with the help of complex algorithms, used to manipulate us through their ads. But the story doesn't end with the ads, our personal data is sold to the highest **3<sup>rd</sup> Party** bidders to make more profit off of it. Unfortunately, the story also doesn't end there, those e-vultures follow us around the web, keep hoarding more and more data about our online activities, and thus generating more profit by selling it. The collected data can be used to manipulate our thoughts and ideas in a particular direction as intended by the highest bidder. Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal[^2] is a good example of how much dangerous a data collection can be, when used as a weapon of mass manipulation for specialized gains.

Another danger of widespread data collection and its negative use is the toll on our mental health. Social media platforms (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, etc.), along with most major websites that serve any kind of content, as well as games, are designed to keep their users hooked by employing behavioral analysis[^4] and complex data analytics. For instance, when you open YouTube, the default page is the Home page rather than your subscription feed. This design encourages users to spend more time on the platform by suggesting videos based on their specific usage patterns on YouTube and other Google products in general. Additionally, when you click on a video, there is a recommended videos section on one side of the video playback, designed to further extend your stay on YouTube.

> Do you ever wonder why Facebook newsfeed just never ends, even though you have a couple of friends added! Why YouTube recommendation page has no end to it! Why can't you scroll to the end of TikTok, Reels, YT Shorts and loads of other services? Do you wonder why games keep nudging you about new reward unlocks or some artificially limited-time offers on in-game assets?

Even our communication privacy is largely at risk due to widespread use of WhatsApp, traditional SMS, iMessage, etc. Although WhatsApp, iMessage[^9] and few others proprietary messaging platforms claim to offer End-to-End Encryption (E2EE), where the sender and receiver are the only ones that can read each other messages. But due to their closed nature, we can't independently verify their claims. Are we comfortable to give those platform access to our chats with our loved ones? Are we willing to see ads based on our chats with our friends and family? I think nobody in their right mind will ever allow this.

> WhatsApp itself don't run any ads, but they do share metadata with their parent company, Meta (formerly Facebook). You will see some flowery language about it, like data sharing for enhanced user experience and improving the infrastructure etc… 
{: .prompt-warning}

> iMessage cloud backups will only use E2EE, when you enable “Advanced Data Protection for iCloud[^8]”.
{: .prompt-tip}

Contrary to the widespread notion that Telegram is more private, it's by default even less private than WhatsApp due to no by-default E2EE. Telegram only uses E2EE when you use secret chat's feature. There is no E2EE in group chats, or default regular chats. Telegram uses their own encryption model instead of industry standard one. There are many other flaws[^6][^7] which will need the blog post of their own. When average users learn about privacy and see telegram mentioned as one of the ways to privately communicate with others, they don't bother to look further and start using it as is, thinking End-to-End Encryption is there by default.
