My Fedora journey started with their Workstation edition. Their vanilla Gnome experience in the beginning got me hooked to them.

But the story doesn't start from Fedora, it rather goes way back in time, when I was first introduced to Linux via Ubuntu. And I find it a breeze for my potato laptop at that time. My Linux Journey is quite complex. Take a look:

_My circle of Life_

> I honestly don't exactly even remember how I have hopped to and from different distros, I haven't added vanilla Debian which I have used for a week. Neither, I have added immutable distros like **SilverBlue** and **OpenSUSE Aeon** which I have used for, months combined. At the end of the day, use whatever distro you want and make it yours. Most of the Distros are fundamentally similar, and you can ideally do anything and everything on each and every distro.

**So let's jump back to the start, where it all began:**

## Ubuntu

I started using Linux exclusively about 4 years ago. Like every other person migrating or at least trying to migrate to Linux, my journey started with **Ubuntu[^1]**. As newbies, we don't know much about Linux controversies around Snaps, SystemD or countless other (countless! I'm not even kidding ðŸ¤”). We decide to take sides on the basis of what's popular opinion is, instead of educated decisions.

Ubuntu is one of my most favorite distros (Sorry, folks ðŸ«£). I liked how Ubuntu team has customized gnome to the near perfection. Most important of all, font rendering on it, is unmatched, I couldn't find a single distro that handle fonts rendering that good out of the box. Due to this, my eyes feel very comfortable, when on Ubuntu. This is one of the many reasons I keep coming back to it.

Apart from being **closed-source** on the server side, the biggest reason I and many other people didn't like **snaps** were their horrible loading times. But this problem is nearly resolved in the recent **Ubuntu releases**, and loading times are even better than **Flatpaks** and closer to the native packages.

## Linux Mint

I then, moved to **Linux Mint[^2]**. It was quite a good experience. I learned about timeshift and got to know about the concept of taking regular backups of your system, in case of emergencies. Linux Mint is a simple but very functional Distro. Their DE, Cinnamon, looks clean but offers a lot of flexibility too.

I personally like the rock solid nature of Linux Mint. I might migrate in the future when full Wayland support will be there. Apart from Wayland, there are very few things I miss on Cinnamon which aren't available else where (Due to the limitation or exclusivity of the DE).

## Arch Linux

Then the hype train of **Arch Linux[^3]** got me. First, I tried to install it manually by following the WIKI to type on Reddit, **BTW, I use Arch**. Due to the lack of enough experience and knowledge, I failed miserably. So, I moved back to Mint. If you're wondering, yes, I'm doing all this on the live system (I like to play tough). Then, I installed it by following a tutorial on YouTube (Arch Users: We don't talk about it). 

Arch Linux is good with high number of latest packages available. The best thing about Arch Linux is by far the ArchWiki, no matter which distro you use, you will eventually come across this amazing Wiki, and find the solution too. I have no negative to say about it, other, It was a bit fast moving target for me to chase.

## openSUSE

**openSUSE[^4]** was a new shiny toy for me with built-in grub snapshots. I liked the implementation of **YAST** for doing almost everything. But after some time, I started missing the terminal. The idea of YAST is good, but again it wasn't for me.

The best thing about OpenSUSE is its **KDE Plasma** experience. Though I have started on **GNOME**, and then shortly after **Cinnamon**, but **openSUSE Tumbleweed** is the reason, I fell in love with Plasma DE. Honestly, I never tried KDE before, and even I don't liked it after watching YouTube reviews. But the experience you get on Tumbleweed is quite remarkable. The openSUSE tools are built in QT, so they look superb there.

> As of November 2023, I use GNOME. I broke up with KDE after extensively using it for several months. Now, I even can't live without GNOME. A couple of months back, I tried to use KDE, but I was immediately lost, so many customization and settings made not to use it. GNOME's simplicity is just wonderful. I use it with only 4 extensions which are just essentials (pano â€” clipboard, vitals â€” temp/memory/network monitor and more, Kstatus and AppIndicator, Caffeine - System Sleep timer).

I jumped ships to OpenSUSE quite early in my Linux journey. The Linux packaging formats and how they worked, I was unaware of. Soon, in this lack of expertise, I started to miss Arch and even Ubuntu (as almost every software is available as `.deb`). The concept of openSUSE build was not known. Quite frankly, I still don't know, how to build packages via OBS (openSUSE Build Service).

The third reason to leave OpenSUSE was, `zypper`. It's slow compared to other available package managers (look who's talking; Cough, Cough! DNF).

## Fedora Workstation[^5]

## Immutable Distros

I have tried these immutable distros so far:

1. SilverBlue[^6] (Fedora's Gnome DE based immutable distro)
2. OpenSUSE Aeon[^7] (OpenSUSE Gnome DE based immutable distro)

### SilverBlue

### openSUSE Aeon
