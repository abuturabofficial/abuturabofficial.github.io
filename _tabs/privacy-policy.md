Privacy Policy for **cyberfront.me**

Effective Date: **2023-11-19**

## 1. Introduction

Ahoy there, savvy internet traveler! Welcome to **[CyberFront](https://cyberfront.me){:target="_blank"}** . This Privacy Policy is our virtual handshake, outlining how we handle your information when you drop by our digital abode.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Personal Information

Fear not, dear visitor! We're not in the business of collecting personally identifiable information (PII). Your secrets are safe with us.

### 2.2 Non-Personal Information

No prying eyes here! We're not using any snoopy analytics tools. Your browser type, device, and operating system are your business, not ours.

## 3. Comments
Ahoy, brave commenter! We've enlisted the help of **Giscus.app**, our trusty sidekick for comments on our posts. When you drop a line, Giscus.app might even do a little dance and display your GitHub username. To join the party, visitors must give the Giscus app a virtual high-five by authorizing it to post on their behalf using the GitHub OAuth flow. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also swing by the GitHub Discussion directly and leave your mark there.

We take your privacy seriously, like guardians of a digital fortress. While we do our utmost to keep your data safe and sound, we encourage you to embark on a quest for knowledge by reviewing GitHub's privacy policy. GitHub, the wizard behind the curtain, is actively brewing up new spells for Discussions and its API. And as for Giscus.app, it's an open-source sorcerer, constantly honing its craft. Be warned, though: the world of tech is ever-changing, and features and practices may morph over time. For the inside scoop on GitHub's privacy practices, consult their sacred scrolls on their website.

## 4. Cookies

No cookies here, unless you're talking about the edible kind. We're sweet tooth-friendly but don't indulge in tracking cookies. However, we do use session storage cookies to remember your dark theme preference during your visit. These cookies are temporary companions, like fireflies in the night—they'll guide you through our pages and then bid you adieu when you close your browser.

Should you worry? Not at all! Session storage cookies are like friendly ghosts; they don't linger. Once you exit our site, they vanish into the digital mist, leaving no trace on your device.

## 5. Third-Party Links

Beware of the wild internet beyond our borders! Clicking on third-party links takes you on an adventure—we're not responsible for the privacy dragons you may encounter. Brave souls, read the privacy policies of those far-off lands.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our website is a playground for grown-ups. If you're under 13, we're like the grown-up rollercoaster—strictly off-limits. If, by chance, we mistakenly got your info, send us a message, and we'll fix it faster than you can say "unicorn."

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

Like a chameleon in a field of rainbows, our Privacy Policy may change colors. Any tweaks will be posted faster than you can refresh your browser.
